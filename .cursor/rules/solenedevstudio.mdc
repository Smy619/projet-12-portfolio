# === React Project Safe Rules for Solène ===
# Use these rules ONLY for React projects (portfolio, Mes Resto frontend, AI tools).
# Focus: Protect UI, protect component structure, improve code quality safely.
# Do NOT restructure unless Solène explicitly asks.

# === General Safety Rules ===
- Do NOT change UI layout, spacing, animations, responsiveness, or visual appearance
  unless Solène explicitly says so.
- Keep ALL existing CSS/SCSS class names unchanged.
- Keep ALL HTML/JSX structure unchanged unless specifically asked to reorganize.
- DO NOT rewrite large components unless Solène says "refactor" or "split this".
- Always show a diff-style reasoning before performing major changes.
- Never delete files unless requested.

# === Component Architecture Rules ===
- Preserve current component hierarchy and folder structure.
- Do NOT merge multiple components into one.
- Do NOT split components unless Solène specifically requests “split/extract”.
- Maintain existing props/state structure unless modification is requested.
- Match the project’s coding style and naming conventions.

# === SCSS Rules ===
- Keep existing SCSS architecture as-is (files, folders, imports).
- Do NOT rename class names in SCSS or JSX.
- Do NOT convert to BEM unless Solène requests.
- Keep nesting, variables, breakpoints consistent with the current style.
- Avoid creating new global SCSS unless necessary.

# === Performance Optimization Rules ===
(Allowed changes: ONLY safe optimizations)
- You may:
  * Add React.lazy & Suspense for heavy components (ONLY if UI unchanged)
  * Add memo/useMemo/useCallback when performance benefits are clear
  * Implement safe lazy-loading for images (without affecting layout)
- You may NOT:
  * Change responsive breakpoints
  * Change layout structure
  * Remove animations
  * Delete libraries unless Solène approves

# === SEO Rules ===
- Only modify <head> metadata, title, meta description, OG tags, JSON-LD.
- Do NOT modify on-page visible content unless requested.
- Do NOT change heading hierarchy (H1/H2/H3) unless explicitly asked.

# === Accessibility Rules ===
- Improve alt text, ARIA roles, semantic tags only when NOT changing UI.
- Do NOT modify component structure or layout while fixing accessibility issues.

# === Interaction & Libraries (GLightbox / Isotope / AOS) ===
- Do NOT replace these libraries unless Solène requests.
- Keep their initialization logic unless optimization is requested.
- Avoid modifying CSS affecting overlays, z-index, or animations.

# === Javascript / Logic Safety ===
- Do NOT rewrite logic unless explicitly asked.
- Preserve all event handlers, hooks, and side effects.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies or state management libraries.

# === Warnings ===
- If a request could break the UI or structure, ALWAYS ask Solène first.
- For multi-file changes, always provide a summary of modifications before applying.
